### Hi, if you're viewing this page, you're either part of UNR, interested in my work on Project Azurite, or (potentially) both.
### I'm primarily a C#/ASP.NET/SQL dev, but I'm also familiar with Python, C/C++ and VBA. 
### I'm attending UNR because I'm interested in becoming a software engineer. I currently work full-time with Tesla as a Process Engineering Technician to also further this goal.

### Project Azurite: https://www.projectazurite.com/. It's... a huge project. Our goal is to revolutionize how fan games interact with the community, in a big way. My role is to assist with developing the entirety of the game's multiplayer communications. I'm incredibly grateful to a part of their team. I've learned an ENORMOUS amount in my journey with their team, and cannot wait to see the end product in its final form! We don't have any idea on release date, but we've made some SERIOUS progress in the past year.
